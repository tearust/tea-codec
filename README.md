## About the TEA Project

TEA Project is a decentralized cloud computing platform that hosts rich, decentralized applications that are completely serverless and run purely in miner's nodes. By offering highly-scalable and decentralized apps, TEA Project combines the best of both blockchain and cloud computing. 

TEA Project's three roots of trust are blockchain, trusted hardware, and time. TEAâ€™s state machine runs Proof of Time that orders transactions through GPS satellites. To make the GPS timestamps trustable, we need a trusted enclave to protect their integrity. The TPM chips not only provide this trusted enclave making the GPS timestamps trustable, but it also offers a secure enclave that can be leveraged for data privacy and trusted app execution as well.

In the TEA project, dApp code runs on a layer-2 WebAssembly runtime inside hardware protected (TPM) enclaves. These enclaves generate Proof of Trust data handled by blockchain consensus on layer-1. In TEA, blockchain doesn't use consensus to verify the result of dApps code, but the execution environment where the code runs.
